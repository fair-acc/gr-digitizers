  brief: Estimates a base frequency of the signal by counting the number of samples between events where signal goes through zero, and computing the time that took, given the sampling rate.
  detail: |-
        This is just a rough estimate of the frequency. To avoid false positives because of noise and
        other undesired components of the signal, the signal is passed through a running average of size
        given by the user. The result itself is then also averaged with the same averaging window for a
        more stable result.

        Meaning the estimate of the frequency is an inverse of the average of the last
        n time intervals it took for the averaged signal(to remove noise) to pass through zero.

        IMPORTANT:
        The specified window must be much smaller than the number of samples in one cycle of the signal!
