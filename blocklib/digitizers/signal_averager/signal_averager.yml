  brief: Average samples in window and generate a single sample.
  detail: |-
        The block decimates the data with the step of window size.

        Tags are attached to the correspondent decimated sample, timebase and acq_info tags
        are fixed with the decimation factor and user provided delay. If more than one acq_info
        tags falls into the same output offset then the tags get merged.

        It supports multiple input signals. Does the same on each input port.
