  brief: Listens for UDP packets. when it receives one, it sends a predetermined number of zeroes, with a tag.
  detail: |-
        User can then do everything else. The format of the datagram is shown below:
        \code
        <edgeDetect
               edge="rising"
               val="0.6545"
               timingEventTimeStamp="timestamp"
               retriggerEventTimeStamp="timestamp"
               delaySinceLastTimingEvent="delay in nanoseconds"
               samplesSinceLastTimingEvent="samples" />
        \endcode

        The stream is composed of only zeroes. It is up to the user to throttle the block.
        When a datagram with this content arrives, the block attaches a tag to the stream.
