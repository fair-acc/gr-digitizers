  brief: Extracts a subset of triggered data.
  detail: |-
        This block uses trigger tags in order to cut out data windows around them and forwards the cut windows to the output
        [ pre-trigger window |  post-trigger window ]

        Trigger and AcqInfo tags in each window are as well forwarded to the outputs.
        Tags are re-created in order to reset the offset. (Just passing them to the output would result in wrong offset values)
