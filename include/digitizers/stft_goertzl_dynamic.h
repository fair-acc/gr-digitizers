     * repsonses, that are linearly interpolated between the lower and upper bound. The
     * boundries are considered as part of the window, except in the case where there is only
     * one bin, in which case the analysis frequency is the average of fMin and fMax,
     * ie. (fMin+fMax)/2. The block returns magnitudes, phase shifts, and frequencies of the
