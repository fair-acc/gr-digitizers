     * \brief Estimates a base frequency of the signal by counting the number of samples between
     * events where signal goes through zero, and computing the time that took, given the sampling rate.
     * This is just a rough estimate of the frequency. To avoid false positives because of noisse and
     * other undesired components of the signal, the signal is passed through a running average of size
     * given by the user. The result itself is then also averaged with the same averaging window for a
     * more stable result.
     *
     * Meaning the estimate of the frequency is an inverse of the average of the last
     * n time intervals it took for the averaged signal(to remove noise) to pass through zero.
     *
     * IMPORTANT:
     * The specified window must be much smaller than the number of samples in one cycle of the signal!
